SILENT PROTOCOL: Comprehensive Game Design Document
1. GAME CONCEPT
SILENT PROTOCOL is conceived as a strategic espionage game that immerses the player in the role of a covert operations chief stationed in West Berlin during the Cold War. The player's perspective is uniquely situated behind the desk of their office, emphasizing a command-and-control approach rather than direct action. All critical intelligence and operational feedback are conveyed through a teletype machine, establishing a distinct thematic and interface constraint that prioritizes textual information over elaborate visual displays.
The foundational version of the game is designed to be fully functional within a Python text interface, allowing for a minimalist yet complete gameplay experience where players receive and respond to intel reports coming through the teletype machine. While the long-term aspiration for SILENT PROTOCOL involves extensive procedural generation of missions and randomization of various game details to enhance replayability, this inaugural iteration will feature a structured narrative. In this initial version, the only randomized elements will be the outcomes of player action rolls, providing a controlled environment for testing and refinement of core systems.
This strategic decision to begin with a fixed narrative, rather than immediate procedural generation, allows for precise balancing and narrative pacing. It serves as a proof of concept for the underlying systems, which can then be expanded to support dynamic content in future iterations, addressing the inherent tension between tightly controlled storytelling and emergent gameplay.
For this initial iteration, several planned features, such as the resource system, procedural generation, random events, and a dedicated equipment system, have been explicitly moved out of scope.
The central objective of the game is a high-stakes mission: locating and neutralizing a stolen nuclear bomb. This overarching "MAIN Mission" is segmented into a hierarchical structure to guide player progression. To complete the main objective, players must successfully accomplish three distinct "CORE missions." Each CORE mission, in turn, is composed of three "SIDE missions." A critical design element dictates that SIDE missions must be completed in a specific, sequential order within their respective chains, while the CORE missions offer players flexibility, allowing them to be completed in any order. This blend of linear and non-linear progression provides both structure and player agency.
Beyond the primary mission line, "ALTERNATIVE missions" are integrated into the gameplay. These optional missions are designed to provide strategic bonuses that can directly influence the success of the main mission, offering players additional avenues for preparation and resource acquisition.
The resolution of all missions, whether core, side, or alternative, hinges on skill checks. These checks typically involve an agent's proficiency in a primary skill. If a secondary skill is listed for a mission action, then the secondary skill is also applied to the calculation. Furthermore, an agent's current attributes and various external factors, such as prevailing weather conditions, significantly influence the likelihood of mission success.
2. ORDER OF GAME
The game commences with an urgent message from CIA command, informing the player of the stolen nuclear bomb and assigning the critical task of its recovery and neutralization. The intelligence specifies that the bomb is slated to be smuggled out of Berlin, and the player's immediate objective is to ascertain WHERE it will be smuggled, WHO will be responsible for the smuggling, and WHEN the attempt is planned to occur. This tripartite intelligence requirement is paramount; the game design dictates that partial information is inherently too risky, as the adversary might alter their plans if they become aware of being tracked. This establishes the high-stakes nature of intelligence gathering and the necessity of comprehensive data.
Each day within the game unfolds with the delivery of a "DAILY REPORT." This crucial intel brief provides the player with local Berlin updates, a current weather report, and a list of known leads available for investigation. This daily report serves as a critical information gateway, controlling the flow of new leads and dynamically introducing environmental modifiers. Players receive this new information and contextual data before making any decisions for the day, which compels them to react to evolving conditions such as changing weather, breaking news, or newly uncovered leads, ensuring the game world feels responsive and alive. The "Daily Intel" explicitly mentions that these reports can introduce "bonuses and penalties to missions," reinforcing that the environment is not merely flavor but an active and influential modifier.
The core loop of gameplay revolves around "Lead Investigation and Action Execution." Known leads, presented in the daily report, can branch into one of three categories: a SIDE MISSION, an ALTERNATIVE MISSION, or a DEAD END. A deliberate design choice is that the player remains unaware of the specific type of mission a lead represents until it has been completed. This element of uncertainty introduces a strategic challenge, compelling players to prioritize leads based on incomplete information and their assessment of risk. Some alternative missions possess the capacity to branch directly from side missions, enabling players to pursue multiple operational paths simultaneously.
To investigate a lead, the player must assign an available agent. The success of this investigation, determined by a random roll (governed by "Intel Phase Success Levels"), dictates the number of actionable options uncovered, ranging from zero to five. Once actions are revealed, the player then assigns an agent to undertake a specific action. Should an action fail, the player is compelled to attempt another action, with the failure potentially imposing penalties or even granting bonuses to the next action in that chain, reflecting adaptive learning or unforeseen opportunities arising from setbacks. Conversely, a successful action yields a new lead, which progresses the mission chain and, like initial leads, requires further investigation to reveal its own set of possible actions.
The completion of the third side mission within any given chain is the pivotal moment, as it reveals one of the vital pieces of information (WHO, WHERE, or WHEN) necessary to complete the corresponding core mission.
Agent deployment is subject to significant time costs; sending agents on missions renders them unavailable for varying durations, ranging from 6 to 24 hours depending on the task. An agent remains occupied until their assigned action is completed, at which point an intel report detailing the outcome is dispatched to the player, and the agent's attributes are adjusted accordingly. The passage of time periods (morning, day, evening, night) also contributes to agent attribute adjustments, such as stamina restoration. This introduces a critical resource management layer, where careful planning of agent deployment is essential.
Mission success is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including agent attributes, prevailing weather conditions, the time of day, local events, and any bonuses or penalties accumulated from preceding missions or actions.
The game operates under a dual-pressure system: a global time limit and an exposure rating. The player is given a strict deadline of 30 days to complete the MAIN mission. Simultaneously, an "exposure rating" continuously tracks the enemy's awareness of the player's operations. Should this rating escalate too high, the smugglers will become aware of being tracked, leading to an immediate mission failure. This combination of a hard time limit and an exposure rating creates a constant strategic challenge. The time limit necessitates aggressive action and efficient planning, as players cannot afford to waste days on low-priority tasks or prolonged agent recovery. Conversely, the exposure rating functions as a "stealth" or "risk" meter for the entire operation. High-risk actions, such as critical mission failures, will inevitably increase exposure, forcing players to sometimes opt for safer, albeit slower, alternatives or allocate resources to reduce exposure, which in turn consumes precious time. This dynamic tension means players must continually weigh the immediate gains of an action against its long-term costs in terms of operational security and temporal resources.
Upon the successful completion of all three CORE missions, the player progresses to the climactic "Final Mission." This is designed as a multi-stage operation, typically requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple agents and a sequence of different actions. The outcome of this final mission is significantly influenced by bonuses accumulated from previously completed core and alternative missions. Furthermore, the current status of the agents deployed—whether they are stressed, wounded, or otherwise compromised—can directly impact their effectiveness during this critical phase. Once the intricate planning for the final operation is complete, the player is presented with a tense teletype readout, detailing the progression of the mission stages and ultimately revealing whether the nuclear bomb was successfully neutralized.
3. AGENT SKILLS
Agents within SILENT PROTOCOL are defined by their specialization in eight core skills. Each mission typically necessitates the application of a primary skill. If a mission action lists or "requires a secondary skill then the secondary skill is applied to the calculation." While not all missions will utilize two skills, a primary skill is always required. This comprehensive skill set enables a diverse range of mission types and encourages player specialization in agent development and deployment.
The eight core skills are:
* Stealth: This skill governs an agent's ability to move undetected and avoid observation during covert operations or surveillance activities.
* Combat: Encompassing general combat proficiency, this skill includes both hand-to-hand engagements and the effective use of firearms across various ranges.
* Deception: This skill pertains to an agent's capacity for lying, impersonation, and maintaining convincing cover identities to mislead and manipulate others.
* Interrogation: Utilized for extracting information, this skill encompasses various methods, including conversational techniques, coercion, and psychological tactics.
* Infiltration: This skill allows agents to bypass physical security measures such as locks, alarms, and other barriers to gain unauthorized access to restricted areas.
* Technical Ops: This proficiency involves the handling, disabling, or installation of electronic devices, surveillance equipment, and other specialized gadgets.
* Information Ops: A broad skill covering forgery, encryption, data manipulation, and the creation or analysis of various documents.
* Intel Gathering: Primarily employed during dedicated Intel phases, this skill focuses on observation, research, and the systematic recording of intelligence.
4. AGENT ATTRIBUTES
Agent attributes are fundamental to their operational capacity and resilience, representing their current condition and overall effectiveness. Effective management of these attributes is critical for ensuring mission success and prolonging the operational lifespan of agents. All attributes begin at a baseline value of 100, indicating no initial penalties.
The actual skill level an agent brings to a mission, known as "Adjusted Skill," is derived by subtracting any accumulated "Total Attribute Penalties" from their "Base Skill". This Adjusted Skill can exceed 100% before the final "Final Skill" cap of 95% is applied. The penalties themselves are intricately linked to specific attributes for each skill: one designated as a "Strong" connection, one as "Moderate," and one as "Weak". These connections apply a penalty based on how far an attribute's current value deviates below 100. The cumulative maximum penalty from all relevant attributes for any given skill is capped at 50%, which would occur if all relevant attributes were at 0.
The coefficients for attribute penalty contributions are:
* Strong Contribution: 0.25% penalty per point the attribute is below 100 (maximum 25% penalty per strong attribute).
* Moderate Contribution: 0.15% penalty per point the attribute is below 100 (maximum 15% penalty per moderate attribute).
* Weak Contribution: 0.10% penalty per point the attribute is below 100 (maximum 10% penalty per weak attribute).
For each relevant attribute, its specific penalty contribution is calculated as: Penalty Contribution_Attr = (100 − Current Attr) × Coefficient_Attr, Skill.
This detailed, granular system ensures that an agent's current physical and mental state directly impacts their effectiveness, compelling players to actively manage agent well-being and recovery.
Attribute Breakdown
The four core agent attributes are:
* Health: This attribute signifies an agent's physical well-being. Injuries directly reduce Health and, consequently, an agent's overall capability. Permanent injuries are a significant risk. Low Health also specifically penalizes Combat and Stealth skills.

   * Degradation: Combat failures are a primary source of Health loss, ranging from -10 for a Partial Failure to -30 for a Total Failure. A critical mission failure also triggers a chance for injury.
   * Recovery: Agents recover +10 Health per day through rest. Utilizing a Medical Facility can accelerate recovery, providing +20 Health per day if the agent's Health is below 50. However, this comes with a -20 anonymity penalty.
   * Critical Threshold: If an agent's Health drops below 10, they are hospitalized for 3 days. If Health drops below 30, a permanent injury can occur, limiting the agent's maximum Health to 70 even after recovery.
   * Stamina: Representing both physical and mental endurance, low Stamina significantly impairs an agent's performance across most skills. It applies penalties to all skills as it degrades.

      * Degradation: Missions incur a flat -10 Stamina cost, with an additional -5 Stamina on mission failure.
      * Recovery: Resting for 8 hours restores +20 Stamina, while simply being idle (not on missions) recovers +5 Stamina per day. A crucial design element is the Health-Dependent Regeneration Modifier: an agent's current Health directly impacts their Stamina recovery rate. At 75-100 Health, recovery is at full rate (+0% modifier). However, at 50-74 Health, Stamina recovery is reduced by 25%; at 25-49 Health, it's reduced by 50%; and below 25 Health, recovery is severely hampered by 75%. This modifier applies to the total Stamina gained from rest or idling, meaning a single injury can effectively sideline an agent for much longer than just the Health recovery time, as their Stamina will remain low, making them ineffective and prone to further critical failures. This creates a cascading failure risk, reinforcing the need for proactive agent health management.
      * Critical Threshold: If Stamina drops below 20, the agent collapses, resulting in an automatic mission failure.
      * Risks: Low Stamina introduces several risks: at ≤75, there's a Minor Injury Risk ((75−Stamina)×1.5%), leading to a loss of 10 Health. At ≤50, there's a Composure Damage risk ((50−Stamina)×1%), resulting in a loss of 5-15 Composure. At ≤20, a Collapse Risk ((20−Stamina)×5%) can incapacitate the agent for 1 mission day.
      * Stimulants: Agents can use stimulants for a one-time boost of +25 Stamina, but this comes at the cost of -10 Composure. This is a one-time, irreversible use per agent (lifetime), intended as a critical, emergency resource.
      * Composure: This attribute reflects an agent's psychological stability under pressure. Low Composure impairs performance in many skills and heightens the risk of panic. It specifically penalizes Deception, Intel Gathering, and Interrogation skills.

         * Degradation: Mission failures reduce Composure, ranging from -5 for a Bare Failure to -20 for a Total Failure. Conversely, successful missions can restore Composure, with +5 for a Solid Success and +10 for an Exceptional Success.
         * Recovery: Resting for 8 hours recovers +5 Composure per day. A dedicated Therapy session provides a significant +20 Composure boost, takes the agent out of the active pool for 24 hours, and only one agent can undergo therapy at a time. Therapy also costs Resources (see Resource System below).
         * Critical Threshold: If Composure drops below 30, the agent panics and abandons their current mission.
         * Breakdown System: When Composure falls to ≤50 during a mission, there's a chance of a "Breakdown" ((50−Composure)×2%, capping at 90% at Composure 1). A breakdown results in a Critical Mission Failure, immediately ending the mission, and renders the agent "Unusable" for 3 days, requiring mandatory rest. This creates a significant "soft" failure state that can be more strategically damaging than simple skill check failures. It means that even highly skilled agents become significant liabilities if their composure is low, forcing players to actively manage mental well-being through rest or therapy, often at the cost of agent availability or resources.
         * Anonymity: This attribute quantifies how "hidden" an agent’s identity and operational cover are. Higher Anonymity directly reduces the overall exposure risk of the operation.

            * Degradation: Mission success can lead to a decrease in Anonymity, typically -5 for a Solid Success or -10 for a Minimal Success (randomized between the two). Failures result in more substantial losses, from -15 to -25 for a Total Failure. Exceptional Successes, however, incur no loss of Anonymity.
            * Recovery: Agents recover +10 Anonymity per day when idle (not on missions). A powerful, one-time recovery option is to "Burn Cover Identity," which provides a +20 Anonymity boost. While this offers a quick fix for dangerously low anonymity, its "permanent retirement" implies that this agent's specific cover identity is no longer viable, potentially leading to narrative implications (e.g., loss of access to specific social circles) or future gameplay consequences (e.g., increased difficulty in establishing new covers). This transforms it from a mere numerical buff into a strategic decision with long-term consequences.
            * Critical Threshold: If Anonymity drops below 40, there is a +30% detection chance.
            * Risks: At Anonymity ≤50, there's a "Mission Penalty Risk" ((50−Anonymity)×2%), resulting in a -25% penalty to mission success chance. A more severe "Crisis" occurs at Anonymity ≤25, triggering a "Stasi Attack Risk" (10% chance per time block, 4 checks/day). If attacked, there's a 50% chance of injury. The consequence is that the agent is forced to hide in a safehouse until their Anonymity rises above 25. Recovery from this state requires the agent to remain in the safehouse until Anonymity reaches ≥30, regaining +5 Anonymity/day while idle.
Skill-Attribute Penalty Formulas
These formulas precisely define how attribute deficiencies translate into skill penalties, with all attribute values ranging from 0 to 100.
Core Rules for Penalties:
            * Attributes start at 100 (no penalty).
            * Penalties are calculated as:
            * Strong Contribution (Coefficient): 0.25% penalty per point the attribute is below 100 (25% max penalty).
            * Moderate Contribution (Coefficient): 0.15% penalty per point the attribute is below 100 (15% max penalty).
            * Weak Contribution (Coefficient): 0.10% per point below 100 (10% max penalty).
            * Adjusted Skill = Base Skill – Total Penalties (minimum 5%, maximum 100%).

Formula Examples (Penalty values are subtracted from the base skill.)
            * Stealth: Adjusted Stealth = Base Stealth − [(100 − Anonymity) × 0.25%] − [(100 − Stamina) × 0.15%] − [(100 − Health) × 0.10%]

               * Example (ORION with degraded attributes: Stealth 92, Anonymity 85, Stamina 72, Health 88):

                  * Anonymity penalty: (100 - 85) × 0.0025 = 3.75%
                  * Stamina penalty: (100 - 72) × 0.0015 = 4.2%
                  * Health penalty: (100 - 88) × 0.001 = 1.2%
                  * Total penalty = 3.75% + 4.2% + 1.2% = 9.15%
                  * Adjusted Stealth = 92 - 9.15 = 82.85% (rounded to 83%)
                  * Combat: Adjusted Combat = Base Combat − [(100 − Health) × 0.25%] − [(100 − Stamina) × 0.15%] − [(100 − Composure) × 0.10%]
                  * Deception: Adjusted Deception = Base Deception − [(100 − Composure) × 0.25%] − [(100 − Anonymity) × 0.15%] − [(100 − Stamina) × 0.10%]

                     * Example (SWAN with degraded attributes: Deception 91, Composure 33, Anonymity 75, Stamina 68):

                        * Composure penalty: (100 - 33) × 0.0025 = 16.75%
                        * Anonymity penalty: (100 - 75) × 0.0015 = 3.75%
                        * Stamina penalty: (100 - 68) × 0.001 = 3.2%
                        * Total penalty = 16.75% + 3.75% + 3.2% = 23.7%
                        * Adjusted Deception = 91 - 23.7 = 67.3% (rounded to 67%)
                        * Interrogation: Adjusted Interrogation = Base Interrogation − [(100 − Composure) × 0.25%] − [(100 − Anonymity) × 0.15%] − [(100 − Stamina) × 0.10%]
                        * Infiltration: Adjusted Infiltration = Base Infiltration − [(100 − Anonymity) × 0.25%] − [(100 − Stamina) × 0.15%] − [(100 − Composure) × 0.10%]
                        * Technical Ops: Adjusted Technical Ops = Base Technical Ops − [(100 − Composure) × 0.25%] − [(100 − Stamina) × 0.15%] − [(100 − Anonymity) × 0.10%]
                        * Information Ops: Adjusted Information Ops = Base Information Ops − [(100 − Anonymity) × 0.25%] − [(100 − Composure) × 0.15%] − [(100 − Stamina) × 0.10%]
                        * Intel Gathering: Adjusted Intel Gathering = Base Intel Gathering (No penalties – only base skill matters.)

                           * Example (GHOST with any attribute levels): Base Intel Gathering: 62. Adjusted Intel Gathering = 62%.
The detailed skill-attribute penalty formulas reveal specific agent vulnerabilities and strengths, which in turn dictate optimal agent deployment. For instance, agents with currently low Composure will struggle significantly with skills such as Deception, Interrogation, Technical Ops, and Information Ops. Similarly, agents with low Stamina will find their Stealth, Combat, Deception, Interrogation, Infiltration, Technical Ops, and Information Ops capabilities hampered. This makes agent selection highly strategic; players cannot simply rely on an agent's highest base skill but must also consider their current attribute levels and how these will impact the specific mission's primary and secondary skill requirements. This reinforces the necessity for agent rotation and recovery, as pushing an agent with low attributes into a mission where those attributes are critical will severely reduce their chance of success.
5. MISSION ACTION FORMULA
The "Mission Action Formula" provides the mathematical framework for determining the probability of success or failure for an agent's mission action, incorporating various bonuses, penalties, and defining the tiers of outcome.
Base Success Chance: The calculation begins with the agent’s "Base Skill," which represents their inherent proficiency in the mission’s primary skill, expressed as a percentage from 1% to 100%. For instance, an agent might have a Base Skill of 70%.
Combine Bonuses (Multiplicative): Bonuses applied to a mission action stack multiplicatively, but with diminishing returns. Each bonus is calculated as a percentage of the remaining gap to 100%. This design choice encourages strategic layering of advantages while preventing single powerful buffs from disproportionately affecting the system. For example, two 50% bonuses do not simply add up to 100%; instead, they combine to a 75% bonus: 1 − ((1 − 0.50) × (1 − 0.50)) = 0.75.
Combine Penalties (Multiplicative): Penalties also stack multiplicatively, with each penalty reducing a percentage of the current success chance. For instance, two 25% penalties combine to a 43.
6. INJURY MECHANICS
The "Injury Mechanics" system introduces a critical layer of consequence and agent management, directly impacting the long-term viability of the player's operative pool. Injuries can be triggered by several in-game events: mission failures, particularly those resulting in a Total Failure; an agent's Stamina dropping to critical levels, leading to collapse; or direct engagement with enemy forces, such as Stasi attacks.
Once an agent is injured, their recovery is managed through distinct healing pathways: Natural Recovery: A basic recovery rate of +5 Health per day is restored when an agent is resting. Medical Treatment: For more severe injuries or faster recovery, agents can receive medical treatment, which provides +15 Health per day. This requires Medical Supplies (see Resource System below). Permanent Injuries: A significant design element is the possibility of permanent injuries. These severe afflictions require specialized interventions, such as prosthetics or surgery, to mitigate their lasting penalties. This requires Advanced Medical Supplies (see Resource System below) and a Medical Facility (a location). The specific mitigation effects (e.g., reducing the permanent penalty by half) would be defined within the implementation of the Medical Facility.
The tiered injury system (Minor, Moderate, Major) with increasing health loss, penalties, and permanence creates a strong incentive for risk mitigation and agent care. Repeatedly pushing agents with low stamina or into high-risk missions (where Total Failure is more likely) significantly increases the chance of not just temporary setbacks, but permanent degradation or even loss of an agent. This forces players to make difficult choices about agent longevity versus immediate mission success. The "Permanent?" column in the injury table is a critical design element, ensuring that critical failures have lasting, tangible impacts on the player's roster, enhancing the emotional investment in agents and making every decision about their deployment consequential.
The game features a comprehensive "Injury Table" that categorizes injuries by their severity, detailing their specific impact on an agent's Health, skills, and recovery time. Refer to Appendix A: Injury Table for a complete list of all injury types and their effects.
7. WEATHER TYPES & EFFECTS
Weather conditions serve as dynamic environmental modifiers that significantly influence mission planning and agent selection. The game incorporates various weather types, each providing specific bonuses, penalties, and unique rules that affect operational outcomes. This system encourages players to adapt their strategies based on the daily environmental conditions, adding a layer of realism to the espionage simulation.
The detailed weather effects create a tactical layer, encouraging players to exploit environmental advantages or mitigate disadvantages. Since the daily intel report provides the weather forecast for the day, players...
11. TIME ADVANCEMENT SYSTEM
The temporal framework of SILENT PROTOCOL is meticulously structured to imbue every decision with a sense of urgency and consequence. Time within the game is measured in hours and days, with each day segmented into four distinct time periods: morning, day, evening, and night. While incoming mission updates will often include minutes for flavor, the primary unit of temporal progression remains the hour.
Time advances through a combination of player actions and explicit manual progression. Agent actions, once initiated, consume a specific amount of game time, but the agents operate independently during this period. For instance, deploying an agent on a mission might take 6 hours, while issuing any individual action generally consumes 1 hour. Beyond action-driven progression, players can explicitly choose to "Advance Time" to a desired point, perhaps to await the completion of a long-duration mission or to strategically align an action with a favorable time block (e.g., executing a stealth mission at night for a bonus).
The passage of time carries significant consequences, dynamically shaping the game world and influencing the player's operational environment:
                           * New Intel Arrivals: As time progresses, new intelligence reports can arrive, most notably the daily intel reports that provide critical updates. Refer to Appendix F: Daily Intel Reports for examples.
                           * Mission Modifiers: Daily intel reports can directly affect certain locations or missions by introducing new bonuses or penalties, reflecting evolving situations on the ground.
                           * Agent Attribute Adjustments: Agent attributes, such as stamina, are periodically adjusted with the passage of each time period, reflecting natural recovery or degradation.
                           * Exposure Consequences: A critical aspect of time passing is its interaction with an agent's anonymity. Low agent anonymity can lead to severe consequences, including the risk of Stasi attacks.
                           * Future Dynamic Events: While a random event system is planned for the future, it is not within the scope of this initial iteration.
A hard time limit of 30 days is imposed for the player to complete the MAIN mission. This overarching deadline creates significant pressure, demanding efficiency and strategic prioritization from the player.
To facilitate player awareness and strategic planning, a constantly visible clock is a required UI element. In the Python text interface version, this clock should be displayed whenever the player is prompted to make a selection. In a future graphical user interface, it should be persistently visible on screen, displaying the current time and date (e.g., "19:00 OCT 4, 1985").
The explicit requirement for a constantly visible clock, especially with time block details, reinforces the importance of time as a core strategic resource. Players require precise knowledge of the time to plan actions that benefit from time-block modifiers (e.g., sending a stealth agent at night) or to manage agent availability for multi-hour missions. This UI detail underscores that time management is a primary mechanic, not a secondary consideration, empowering players to make informed, time-sensitive decisions.
12. MISSION SYSTEM & CONTENT
The mission system in SILENT PROTOCOL is designed to provide a structured yet dynamic progression through the game's core narrative. Missions are initially introduced to the player as "leads". These leads are not immediately actionable; they must first be investigated by an agent, a process that reveals the specific actions that can be performed to complete the mission. Once these actions are uncovered, the player can then assign agents to execute them.
Mission chains, representing the interconnected sequence of tasks, can also be accessed and reviewed on the "corkboard". For a more streamlined user experience, a future enhancement may involve combining the "leads" and "corkboard" systems into a single "corkboard" interface, where new leads are clearly identified with a "(lead)" tag to indicate they initiate a new mission chain.
A key design principle is the obfuscation of mission types. The player will not know whether a given mission is a core mission, an alternative mission, or a side mission until its completion. The only indication that a mission chain was a core mission is the revelation of one of the critical WHO, WHERE, or WHEN objectives. Even then, the game will not explicitly label it a "core mission" but rather inform the player that a "crucial clue about the bomb has been uncovered".
This design choice introduces a significant strategic challenge and enhances replayability. Players are compelled to make decisions about which leads to pursue without full knowledge of their ultimate importance or impact on the main objective. This introduces a risk-reward element to lead prioritization; players might spend valuable time and agent resources on a Dead End or an Alternative Mission when a Core Mission was available. This enhances replayability, as players will learn optimal paths through trial and error, while also adding a layer of difficulty and realism to intelligence operations, where information is always incomplete and decisions are made under uncertainty. This makes the "Intel Gathering" skill particularly valuable.
When the player selects an action for a mission, comprehensive information is provided to facilitate informed decision-making:
                           * The specific objective of the action (e.g., "find out who is moving the crates").
                           * The required skill types for successful execution (e.g., Stealth/Technical Ops).
                           * Any applicable bonuses or penalties, which can stem from daily events, random occurrences, prevailing weather conditions, or the outcomes of previous actions.
                           * An estimated completion time for the action (e.g., 6 hours).
Upon selecting an agent, a list of available operatives is displayed, complete with their relevant skill scores, attribute numbers, and any specific bonuses or penalties they currently possess. Optionally, if an equipment system is implemented, the player will be able to assign available equipment to the agent for the mission.
While the initial iteration of SILENT PROTOCOL features a structured narrative, procedural generation of missions is a future development goal and is out of scope for this initial iteration. For this future implementation, key variables and templates for generating missions include Location, Target, and Action Type. A current internal table already contains a compilation of locations, characters, and 50 distinct mission types to serve as a foundation for this dynamic content. Refer to Appendix B: Mission Types for a complete list.
Mission success or failure is determined by a roll check against the agent's adjusted base skill, with all applicable bonuses and penalties factored in. The game features a detailed table outlining different tiers of success and failure, each with specific outcomes. These "Game Results" for partial success, full success, and failure are elaborated in the "Mission Action Success Levels" and "Detailed Mission Action Outcomes" sections. Consequences can range from an "Agent injured" or "Intel compromised" to "Bonus resources gained" or a "penalty to next action," or even the revelation of a "new lead". The final mission, however, culminates in a binary win or lose outcome, representing ultimate success or failure.
"Alternative Missions" currently grant bonuses directly to the final mission, specifically based on skill type (e.g., a +10% Stealth bonus to the final mission). Other potential bonuses, such as reduced mission time, are yet to be brainstormed for future integration.
The completion of the "Main Mission" is contingent upon discovering all three critical clues (WHO, WHERE, and WHEN) through the successful completion of the CORE missions. Once these objectives are met, the player can proceed to plan the final mission. Players also have the option to complete any outstanding alternative missions to maximize their bonuses for the final confrontation. The player must then await the specific time of the smuggling attempt before initiating the final operation. This final mission is designed as a multi-stage action plan, often requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple agents. Once the planning phase is complete, the player can either manually advance time or select a newly available option, "execute operation Thunderbolt," to play out the climactic final mission.
13. AGENT MANAGEMENT & PROGRESSION
Effective agent management is paramount to success in SILENT PROTOCOL. The player begins the game with a pre-established roster of agents available within their office. These agents are the primary tools for mission execution, selected and assigned to investigate leads or carry out specific mission actions as determined by the player. Beyond mission deployment, agents require careful individual management through special actions accessible via their roster profiles. These include ordering an agent to rest, administering stimulants, arranging therapy sessions, or sending them to a safehouse for recovery.
Agent progression within the game is designed to be impactful yet balanced. Agents can gain a small amount of experience and improve their skills through successful operations. Specifically, a 5% skill bonus is awarded after critical successes, though this increase is subject to diminishing returns as an agent's skill level rises, preventing them from becoming overly powerful. Given the game's focused duration, a dedicated training system for agents is not currently implemented.
The consequences of critical mission failure are severe and lasting. If an agent critically fails a mission, they incur a penalty to their next mission, making subsequent tasks more challenging. Furthermore, a critical failure carries a chance of the agent becoming injured. Should an injury occur, a random injury is selected from the detailed injury table (Refer to Appendix A: Injury Table), with the severity of the injury being influenced by the number of existing injuries of that severity. Agents also suffer greater attribute degradation as a direct result of critical mission failures, further compounding their operational limitations. This system emphasizes risk and consequences, forcing players to carefully weigh the potential costs of high-stakes operations on their valuable human assets.
14. EXTERNAL FACTORS & DYNAMIC EVENTS
The game world of SILENT PROTOCOL is not static; it is dynamically influenced by various external factors, adding a layer of realism and unpredictability to operations. Foremost among these are weather conditions and the time of day, which are based on actual historical weather reports from October 1985 in West Berlin. These environmental elements directly influence missions by applying specific bonuses or penalties, compelling players to adapt their strategies accordingly.
Information regarding these external factors is consistently provided to the player. The daily intel report always includes the current weather forecast, and the player is continuously aware of the prevailing weather conditions, which are visually represented by the in-game clock. In addition to weather, daily intel reports also list any significant local events or indicators of enemy activity that may introduce bonuses or penalties to specific missions. For enhanced thematic immersion, these modifiers might not always be explicitly listed as percentage numbers but could instead be conveyed narratively, such as "risk raised due to" a specific event.
While the current iteration integrates historical weather and daily events, future development plans include the implementation of a more robust random event system and a dynamic political climate. These additions are intended to introduce further unpredictable elements and broader geopolitical influences, creating an even more complex and responsive game world. This ongoing development indicates a commitment to adding more dynamic and unpredictable elements to the game world over time.
15. USER INTERFACE (UI) & PRESENTATION
The user interface of SILENT PROTOCOL is designed to reinforce the game's unique "behind the desk POV" and Cold War espionage theme. The teletype machine serves as the central and most prominent element, acting as the primary conduit for all information and feedback.
The player's desk will feature a suite of interactive and thematic UI elements:
                           * Teletype Machine: This will be the primary information display, visually and functionally printing text with accompanying sound effects. In the early Python version, it is intended to function like an 80s computer terminal. All mission results will be delivered as new teletype messages, maintaining thematic consistency. Refer to Appendix H: Teletype Template Examples for examples.
                           * Mission Logs Folder: A physical representation of collected mission data.
                           * Agent's Files: Allows access to detailed information about individual agents.
                           * Corkboard: A visual representation of current mission threads and uncovered clues, with strings connecting different pieces of intelligence.
                           * Clock: A visible display showing the current time and weather, crucial for strategic planning.
                           * Filing Cabinet: Implies access to archived information or resources.
                           * Die Welt Newspaper: Provides daily news and contextual information.
                           * Safe: Contains special equipment that can be utilized by agents. This refers to the Equipment System (see below).
                           * Window: Offers a visual representation of the current weather conditions outside the office.
Player choices will initially be presented as numbered options within the Python text interface. The long-term vision is to transition this input method to clickable buttons in a more advanced graphical user interface.
The desired visual style for the game is a pixelated retro aesthetic, drawing inspiration from titles like "Papers, Please". This choice aligns with the Cold War setting and enhances the immersive atmosphere. The audio design will further contribute to this immersion, featuring distinct teletype sounds, suspenseful background music to heighten tension, and applicable weather sounds to reflect environmental conditions.

	16. GAME STATE & PERSISTENCE
To ensure player progress is maintained and the game can be continued across sessions, a robust "Game State & Persistence" mechanism is essential. The system must effectively track all relevant data points to reconstruct the exact state of the game at any given moment.
The critical data points that require saving include:
                           * Current Time: The precise date and time within the game world.
                           * Mission Progress: The status of all active and completed core, side, and alternative missions, including which leads have been investigated and which actions have been taken.
                           * Agent Stats: Comprehensive details for each agent, encompassing their current skill levels, attribute values (Health, Stamina, Composure, Anonymity), and any injuries they have sustained.
                           * Acquired Bonuses and Penalties: Any temporary or permanent modifiers affecting agents or missions.
                           * Inventory: If an equipment system is implemented, the current inventory of items and resources.
A crucial design decision regarding saving and loading is the implementation of an auto-save mechanism, with no provision for manual saving or loading of multiple save slots. This approach is explicitly likened to the design philosophy of games like FTL, where players are prevented from backtracking or "save scumming". This "no manual saving" rule is a deliberate design choice to enforce consequence and heighten tension. In a game of espionage, every decision carries weight, and a bad outcome—a failed mission, an injured agent, or mismanaged attributes—cannot be simply undone by reloading a previous state. This forces players to live with the consequences of their actions, fostering a profound sense of realism and tension that mirrors the high-stakes nature of covert operations. This aligns with the game's overall theme of difficult choices and irreversible outcomes, making the player's role as "Spy Chief" more impactful and challenging.
The game is designed exclusively as a single-player experience, with no considerations for multiplayer or sharing functionalities.
17. NARRATIVE & WORLD
The narrative and world of SILENT PROTOCOL are deeply rooted in a specific historical context, aiming to provide a compelling and immersive espionage experience. The game is set in 1985 West Berlin, a city emblematic of Cold War tensions and covert operations.
Beyond the central objective of locating a stolen nuclear bomb, the narrative integrates elements from the real 1985 West Berlin. This includes the use of actual Die Welt newspapers to reflect the political climate of the era, providing a layer of historical authenticity and influencing in-game events. The player's role as the "Spy Chief" is characterized by an isolated command position; direct interaction with other characters, such as non-player characters (NPCs), is not a feature. Instead, the player operates exclusively through their agents, issuing commands and receiving reports through the teletype. While not in the initial build, a future possibility includes an interrogation system for captured enemy agents, which would introduce a new form of indirect interaction.
The West Berlin setting profoundly influences both the gameplay and the narrative through several key aspects:
                           * Specific Locations: The game features a comprehensive compilation of locations, categorized for operational relevance. Refer to Appendix C: Locations for a complete list.
                           * Political Tensions: The pervasive Cold War backdrop, the omnipresent threat of Stasi activity, and the stark East/West divide are central to the game's atmosphere and challenges.
                           * Espionage Themes: The entire game revolves around core espionage themes: covert operations, meticulous intel gathering, and the constant management of risk inherent in clandestine activities.
18. TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The initial development of SILENT PROTOCOL is planned for a Python environment. This choice allows for the creation of the most basic functional version of the game, leveraging Python's capabilities for text-based interfaces and core game logic. The user has indicated uncertainty regarding the implementation of the game for a web browser, suggesting that this may be a future consideration or an area where further technical guidance would be beneficial.
Regarding front-end frameworks or libraries, the user is unfamiliar with these concepts. This implies that if web-based development is pursued, the technical team would need to make informed decisions on suitable technologies (e.g., plain HTML/JS) or provide educational guidance to the user. Similarly, the user is unfamiliar with specific backend requirements. For the initial iteration, a pragmatic approach would involve handling game state persistence client-side, which is often a simpler starting point for development. This minimizes the need for complex server infrastructure in the early stages.
19. AGENTS
The operational backbone of SILENT PROTOCOL is its roster of highly specialized CIA operatives. Each agent is provided with a detailed personnel file, outlining their code name, true identity, biographical background, core skill ratings, and current attribute levels. These profiles are crucial for players to formulate immediate agent selection strategies tailored to specific mission requirements. Refer to Appendix G: Agent Profiles for detailed information on each agent.
A striking commonality observed across all provided agent profiles is their consistently low Composure attribute. For instance, ORION has a Composure of 14, SWAN 33, EMBER 22, and JACKAL 16. This design choice suggests that Composure management will be a primary and pervasive challenge for the player across their entire roster, not just for a few specific agents. Given that the "Composure Breakdown System" triggers at Composure ≤50, leading to "Critical Mission Failure" and rendering the agent "Unusable" for 3 days, almost every agent starts with a significant psychological vulnerability. This makes them inherently prone to critical failures if pushed too hard, compelling players to prioritize constant agent rotation and investment in recovery methods such as rest or therapy. This elevates Composure from a secondary statistic to a critical strategic element, ensuring that players cannot simply rely on high skill numbers but must also diligently manage the mental well-being of their entire team under pressure, adding a layer of realism to the psychological toll of espionage.
The roster includes:
                           * ORION (Elias Monroe Richter): A male, 36-year-old US citizen with a background in Marine Corps Force Recon. He specializes in Stealth (92), Combat (90), and Intel Gathering (81).

                           * Initial Attributes: Health: 100, Stamina: 100, Composure: 100, Anonymity: 100
20. LEADS AT START OF GAME
The game's initial phase presents the player with a set of predefined leads, serving as the starting points for all operational activities. These leads are strategically designed to branch into either the critical core missions, beneficial alternative missions, or resource-consuming dead ends, immediately introducing elements of choice and uncertainty.
The starting leads are:
                           * Core Mission 1 (WHERE): "Suspicious shipments at Westhafen Dockyard". This lead initiates the investigation to determine the bomb's smuggling location.
                           * Core Mission 2 (WHO): "Stasi informant leaking NATO intel". This lead begins the pursuit to identify the individual responsible for the smuggling.
                           * Core Mission 3 (WHEN): "GRU officer Sergei Koslov defecting". This lead sets off the efforts to uncover the planned time of the smuggling attempt.
                           * Alternative Mission 1 (Defector’s Gambit): "Stasi officer Klaus Fiedler seeks asylum". This optional lead can provide strategic bonuses.
                           * Alternative Mission 2 (Radio Jammer/Signal Hunt): "RIAS Radio jamming detected". Another optional lead, potentially offering tactical advantages.
                           * Alternative Mission 3 (Blueprint Hunt): "Punk Club SO36 black-market rumors". This alternative mission can have branching outcomes, with one path leading to a bonus and another to a dead end.
                           * Dead End 1: "Abandoned truck near Checkpoint Charlie". This lead results in empty cargo and wastes player time and resources.
                           * Dead End 2: "Mysterious fires in Neukölln". This lead is revealed to be arson by children, also consuming resources without mission progress.
This initial set of choices immediately sets the stage for the main narrative, while simultaneously introducing optional paths and diversions that require careful consideration of resource allocation and risk.
21. COMPLETE MISSION FLOW CHART
The "Complete Mission Flow Chart" serves as a comprehensive visual blueprint of the game's structured narrative progression. It meticulously maps out the interconnectedness of all core and standalone alternative missions, detailing how they branch from the initial starting leads. This chart explicitly illustrates the dependencies between missions, showing which side missions lead to core objectives and how alternative missions can provide crucial bonuses to the final operation. It is an indispensable tool for understanding the game's overall structure and the various paths a player can take.
22. CORE MISSION OUTLINES
The "Core Mission Outlines" provide a detailed breakdown of the primary storyline, specifying the objectives and actionable steps for each side mission within the three core objectives: WHO, WHERE, and WHEN. Each action within these outlines is further detailed with its potential success outcomes (ranging from Level 0 to Level 5), the resulting game effects (such as penalties, bonuses, or the revelation of new leads), and ultimately, the completion of the mission.

24. STANDALONE ALTERNATE MISSIONS
In addition to the core mission chains, SILENT PROTOCOL includes several "Standalone Alternate Missions" that are triggered directly from the initial set of leads available at the start of the game. These missions provide optional objectives that, if successfully completed, can grant valuable bonuses to the final mission, enhancing the player's strategic options.
                           * AM1: Defector’s Gambit
                           * Trigger: Starting lead "Stasi officer Klaus Fiedler seeks asylum".
                           * Lead: Fiedler claims to know Valkyrie’s backup plan.
                           * Missions: Verify Fiedler (Deception/Intel), Extract him (Stealth/Combat), Decrypt weak points (Technical).

                           * AM3: Blueprint Heist
                           * Trigger: Starting lead "Punk Club SO36 black-market rumors".
                           * Lead: Smuggler selling bomb schematics.
                           * Missions: Infiltrate club (Stealth), Find blueprints (Intel).
                           * Branching Outcome: Players can choose to Steal from Stasi liaison, which grants a +10% Infiltration bonus, or Raid KGB buyer, which leads to a Dead End.
25. DEAD ENDS
"Dead Ends" are a deliberate design element in SILENT PROTOCOL, introducing a layer of realism and consequence to the player's choices. These are initial leads that, despite requiring player time and resources for investigation, ultimately yield no progress towards the main objective. They serve to simulate the inherent uncertainties and wasted efforts often encountered in real-world intelligence operations.
The starting leads identified as Dead Ends are:
                           * Abandoned Truck: The lead "Abandoned truck near Checkpoint Charlie". Investigation reveals it to be empty cargo, leading to a Dead End.
                           * Neukölln Fires: The lead "Mysterious fires in Neukölln". Investigation uncovers that these fires were merely arson committed by children, resulting in a Dead End.
While Dead Ends consume valuable time and agent resources, the game design specifies that they do not incur any additional penalties beyond the wasted effort. This ensures that while they are frustrating, they do not catastrophically derail the player's campaign.
26. FINAL MISSION
The "Final Mission" represents the climactic culmination of the player's efforts throughout the campaign in SILENT PROTOCOL. Its singular objective is to Neutralize the Bomb at Schönberg Crossing.
This mission is designed as a multi-stage operation, typically involving the coordinated deployment of multiple agents and a sequence of different actions. The success of this critical operation is directly influenced by the strategic decisions and achievements made throughout the preceding core and alternative missions. The game features a system of "stacked bonuses" that are applied to the final mission based on successful completion of specific alternative missions. These include:
                           * A +10% Stealth bonus (from Defector’s Gambit).
                           * A +10% Tech Ops bonus (from Signal Hunt or Project Zeta).
                           * A +10% Infiltration bonus (from Safehouse Shadow or Blueprint Heist).
Furthermore, the current status of the agents chosen for the final mission plays a crucial role. Agents who are stressed, wounded, or otherwise compromised during the campaign will have their usefulness affected in this critical phase. This ensures that prior strategic decisions regarding agent care and deployment have lasting implications for the ultimate success or failure of the operation. Once the intricate planning for this final, high-stakes mission is complete, the player is treated to a tense teletype readout, detailing the progression of its various stages and ultimately revealing whether the player succeeded in neutralizing the bomb.
27. FIRST CORE MISSION

These locations are categorized to reflect their primary function and strategic relevance. For a complete list of locations, refer to Appendix C: Locations.
29. CHARACTERS
The game world is populated by a diverse cast of characters, each associated with specific locations and possessing roles that can directly influence missions. These individuals can serve as targets for intelligence gathering, potential sources of information, or obstacles to overcome. For a complete list of characters and their roles, refer to Appendix D: Characters.
30. WEATHER REPORTS
The game integrates detailed "Weather Reports" for October 1985 at Tempelhof Airport, providing a realistic and dynamic environmental backdrop that directly influences mission outcomes. These reports are broken down into four daily time blocks: Morning (6–12), Day (12–18), Evening (18–24), and Night (0–6). For detailed weather data and their effects, refer to Appendix E: Weather Reports.
31. DAILY INTEL REPORTS
The "Daily Intel Reports" serve as the primary narrative and informational feed for the player, delivered chronologically for September and October 1985. Each report provides a snapshot of major news items, encompassing both local West Berlin updates and broader international events. These reports are designed to influence gameplay by potentially introducing specific bonuses or penalties to missions. For a complete list of daily intel reports, refer to Appendix F: Daily Intel Reports.
32. INTEL PHASE SUCCESS LEVELS
The "Intel Phase Success Levels" define the outcome of an agent's initial investigation into a lead, determining how many actionable options are revealed to the player. This mechanism introduces a layer of information gathering before committing to specific mission actions, adding tactical depth to the game.
The levels are as follows:
                           * Level 0: 0 actions revealed. This indicates a complete failure in intelligence gathering, leaving the player with no immediate options for the lead.
                           * Level 1: 1 action revealed. A minimal success, providing only one actionable path.
                           * Level 2: 2 actions revealed. A moderate success, offering limited choices.
                           * Level 3: 3 actions revealed. A solid intelligence effort, providing several viable options.
                           * Level 4: 4 actions revealed. A thorough intelligence gathering, offering a wide range of choices.
                           * Level 5: 5 actions revealed + 10 Bonus to mission actions. This represents an exceptional intelligence coup, not only revealing all possible actions but also providing a direct bonus to subsequent mission actions.
This tiered outcome for the intel phase influences subsequent tactical choices, as a higher level of success provides the player with more flexibility and potentially better options for completing the mission.
33. MISSION ACTION SUCCESS LEVELS
The "Mission Action Success Levels" system provides granular feedback and defines the consequences for every action an agent undertakes during a mission. This detailed outcome structure drives the iterative gameplay loop, ensuring that every decision carries weight and influences subsequent events.
The six distinct levels of mission action success are:
                           * Level 0 – Failure: The action fails completely, resulting in no progress towards the mission objective. This outcome carries potential negative repercussions, such as an increase to the local alert level or the imposition of future penalties. Critically, any follow-up action in the same chain will receive a 10% penalty.
                           * Level 1 – Minimal Success: The action is incomplete, meaning it does not fully achieve its objective. To proceed, a follow-up action is required. No bonus is applied to this subsequent attempt.
                           * Level 2 – Limited Success: Similar to Minimal Success, the action remains incomplete and necessitates a follow-up action. However, this level of success grants a +25% bonus to the next attempt in the chain, indicating some progress or a partial advantage gained.
                           * Level 3 – Solid Success: The action is still incomplete, requiring a follow-up action. This level provides a significant +50% bonus to the next attempt, reflecting substantial progress or a strong advantage established.
                           * Level 4 – Full Success: The action is completed successfully, and no further effort is needed for this specific task. This represents a clean and efficient execution of the objective.
                           * Level 5 – Exceptional Success: This is the highest tier of success, where the action is completed with outstanding results. Beyond simply completing the action, the player gains a substantial +10% bonus that applies to the next mission in the same chain (e.g., a subsequent side mission or the final mission).
This system ensures that even partial successes provide some form of advantage, while failures impose tangible setbacks, constantly forcing players to adapt and strategize.
34. DETAILED MISSION ACTION OUTCOMES
The "Detailed Mission Action Outcomes" section provides extensive, concrete examples of the teletype transcripts that players will receive following each mission action. These transcripts are crucial for illustrating the immediate narrative outcome, the specific game results (including penalties, bonuses, or new leads), and any recommendations for the player's next steps. They serve as direct implementations of the "Mission Action Formula" and "Mission Action Success Levels," providing clear guidance for development and demonstrating the player's immersive experience. Refer to Appendix H: Teletype Template Examples for examples of teletype messages.
These detailed examples cover various actions within Core Mission 1, such as:
                           * Investigate Increased Nighttime Traffic: Transcripts detail outcomes from complete failure (e.g., "Surveillance compromised. East Berlin civil patrol entered security zone... -50% penalty to next action") to exceptional success (e.g., "Agent secured full observational coverage... 'Otto' indirectly acknowledged... +10% bonus to the next action in Otto’s mission chain").
                           * Attempt to trace license plate fragment: Illustrates how partial information can still lead to progress or reveal new leads, even if the primary objective isn't immediately met.
                           * Infiltrate Bay B for crate inspection: Provides examples of how infiltration attempts can yield varying levels of intelligence or directly reveal critical figures like "Otto".
                           * Investigate courier uniform source: Shows how seemingly minor details can lead to significant breakthroughs and identify key individuals.
                           * Trace outgoing transmission signal: Details the process of electronic intelligence gathering, from failed intercepts to confirming key figures like "Otto".
The document also includes detailed Intel Phase outcomes for Core Mission 1 Side Mission 2 ("Bug Otto's Safehouse") and Core Mission 1 Side Mission 3 ("A Hidden Manifest"), showing how different levels of intel gathering reveal varying numbers of actionable options.
Furthermore, specific action outcomes are provided for missions related to Otto's operations and the Warehouse 47 investigation, such as:

                           * Trace Otto’s Exfiltration Route: Details how tracking can confirm "Warehouse 47" as an exfil node and reveal broader network patterns.
                           * Sneak infiltration via rooftop or tunnels (Warehouse 47): From failed entry attempts to successfully retrieving the manifest and revealing "Schönberg Crossing" and the 0445h time.
                           * Stage fake delivery to gain access (Warehouse 47): Shows how deception can lead to manifest retrieval.
                           * Bribe warehouse guard (Warehouse 47): Illustrates how corruption can provide access to critical information.
                           * Set off small diversionary fire nearby (Warehouse 47): Details how tactical diversions can create windows for infiltration.
                           * Hack shipment computer terminal during fake inspection (Warehouse 47): Demonstrates how technical operations can digitally retrieve the manifest.
These extensive examples provide clear, narrative-driven feedback for every player action, making the consequences of success and failure tangible and immersive.
35. RESOURCE SYSTEM
The game incorporates a basic resource system to manage certain agent actions and recovery options. These resources represent the logistical and financial backing required for covert operations.
                           * Resources: A general currency or pool representing operational funds and supplies.
                           * Acquisition: Resources are acquired through successful missions (e.g., a bonus for completing an Alternative Mission, or a specific mission outcome might yield resources). A baseline daily or weekly resource income is also provided by HQ to cover basic operational costs.
                           * Consumption:
                           * Therapy Sessions: Cost a certain amount of Resources per session (e.g., 50 Resources per session).
                           * Medical Supplies: Required for Medical Treatment (e.g., 20 Resources per use).
                           * Advanced Medical Supplies: Required for Permanent Injury mitigation (prosthetics/surgery) (e.g., 100 Resources per use).
                           * Equipment: If an Equipment System is implemented, equipment will consume resources for acquisition or maintenance.
This system adds a layer of strategic management, forcing players to balance operational needs with available funds.
CONCLUSIONS
The SILENT PROTOCOL game design document presents a robust and meticulously detailed blueprint for a strategic espionage simulation. The core premise of a behind-the-desk POV, with information conveyed via a teletype, establishes a unique and immersive thematic foundation. The game's structured narrative, while initially fixed, is designed with a clear pathway for future procedural generation, indicating a long-term vision for high replayability.
The intricate interplay of agent skills and attributes, coupled with a granular mission action formula, creates a complex and challenging decision-making environment. The detailed attribute degradation and recovery mechanics, particularly the health-dependent stamina recovery and the composure breakdown system, introduce significant strategic depth. These elements ensure that agent management is not merely a numerical exercise but a critical aspect of operational longevity, forcing players to balance immediate mission needs with the long-term well-being of their operatives. The commonality of low composure among starting agents suggests that psychological resilience will be a pervasive challenge, demanding proactive management through rest and therapy.
The dual pressure of a global time limit and an exposure rating creates a constant tension, compelling players to make difficult trade-offs between speed and operational security. The tiered injury system, with its potential for permanent consequences, further heightens the stakes of every mission. Environmental factors, such as dynamic weather and time-block modifiers, add another layer of tactical consideration, rewarding players who adapt their strategies to prevailing conditions.
The design's emphasis on obfuscating mission types until completion, coupled with the diminishing returns on skill progression, encourages strategic risk-taking and diversified agent development. The comprehensive mission outlines, locations, and character lists provide a rich world for operations, while the detailed action outcomes ensure clear feedback and progression. The decision to implement auto-save without manual backtracking, akin to FTL, reinforces the game's commitment to consequence and high-stakes decision-making.
Overall, the design document provides a comprehensive and coherent vision for SILENT PROTOCOL, laying a solid foundation for development that promises a challenging, immersive, and strategically deep espionage experience.
