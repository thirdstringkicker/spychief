SILENT PROTOCOL GAME DESIGN
SILENT PROTOCOL: Core Game Mechanics & Data
1. GAME CONCEPT
* Genre: Strategic espionage game.
* Setting: West Berlin, Cold War.
* Player Role: Covert operations chief.
* Perspective: Command-and-control from an office desk.
* Primary Interface: Teletype machine for all intelligence and operational feedback (textual).
* Initial Version: Python text interface.
* Narrative (Initial Version): Structured narrative. Procedural generation is a long-term goal.
* Randomization (Initial Version): Only outcomes of player action rolls.
* Main Objective: Locate and neutralize a stolen nuclear bomb ("MAIN Mission").
* Mission Structure:
   * MAIN Mission requires completion of 3 "CORE missions."
   * Each CORE mission comprises 3 "SIDE missions."
   * SIDE missions must be completed sequentially within their chain.
   * CORE missions can be completed in any order.
* "ALTERNATIVE missions": Optional missions providing strategic bonuses for the MAIN Mission.
* Mission Resolution: Skill checks involving an agent's primary skill, and secondary skill if listed. Influenced by agent attributes and external factors (e.g., weather).
2. ORDER OF GAME
* Game Start: CIA command informs player of a stolen nuclear bomb; recovery and neutralization is the task.
* Initial Objective: Determine WHERE the bomb will be smuggled, WHO will smuggle it, and WHEN the attempt will occur. All three pieces of information are required.
* Daily Cycle:
   * Player receives a "DAILY REPORT" containing local Berlin updates, a weather report, and new leads.
   * Reports introduce environmental modifiers (bonuses/penalties to missions).
* Gameplay Loop: Lead Investigation and Action Execution.

   * Leads can be a SIDE MISSION, an ALTERNATIVE MISSION, or a DEAD END. Player is unaware of type until completion.
   * Alternative missions may branch from side missions.
   * Lead Investigation: Assign an agent. Success (random roll based on "Intel Phase Success Levels") reveals 0-5 actionable options.
   * Action Execution: Assign an agent.

      * Failure: Player must attempt another action; failure may incur penalties or grant bonuses to the next action in that chain.
      * Success: Yields a new lead, requiring further investigation.
      * Completion of the 3rd side mission in a chain reveals one critical piece of intelligence (WHO, WHERE, or WHEN) for the corresponding core mission.
      * Agent Deployment: Agents are unavailable for 6-24 hours while on missions. Outcome reported via teletype; attributes adjusted.
      * Time Passage: Segmented into morning, day, evening, night. Affects attribute adjustments (e.g., stamina restoration).
      * Mission Success Factors: Agent attributes, weather, time of day, local events, accumulated bonuses/penalties.
      * Pressure System:
      * Global Time Limit: 30 days to complete the MAIN mission.
      * Exposure Rating: Tracks enemy awareness. High exposure leads to mission failure.
      * Final Mission:
      * Unlocked after completing all 3 CORE missions.
      * Multi-stage operation requiring multiple agents and a sequence of actions.
      * Outcome heavily influenced by bonuses from completed core/alternative missions and the current status of deployed agents.
      * Resolution detailed via teletype.
3. AGENT SKILLS
      * Agents have 8 core skills. Missions require a primary skill; secondary skill applied if listed.
      * Skills List:
      * Stealth: Move undetected, avoid observation.
      * Combat: Hand-to-hand and firearms proficiency.
      * Deception: Lying, impersonation, maintaining cover.
      * Interrogation: Extracting information (conversation, coercion, psychological tactics).
      * Infiltration: Bypassing physical security (locks, alarms).
      * Technical Ops: Handling, disabling, or installing electronic devices/gadgets.
      * Information Ops: Forgery, encryption, data manipulation, document creation/analysis.
      * Intel Gathering: Observation, research, recording intelligence (during Intel phases).
4. AGENT ATTRIBUTES
      * Represent an agent's current condition and effectiveness. All attributes start at 100 (no penalty).
      * Adjusted Skill Calculation:
      * Adjusted Skill = Base Skill - Total Attribute Penalties.
      * Adjusted Skill can exceed 100% before a final cap of 95% ("Final Skill") is applied.
      * Maximum cumulative penalty from all relevant attributes for a skill is 50% (if all attributes are 0).
      * Penalty Coefficients (per point attribute is below 100):
      * Strong Contribution: 0.25% (max 25% penalty per strong attribute).
      * Moderate Contribution: 0.15% (max 15% penalty per moderate attribute).
      * Weak Contribution: 0.10% (max 10% penalty per weak attribute).
      * Individual Attribute Penalty: Penalty Contribution_Attr = (100 − Current Attr) × Coefficient_Attr, Skill.
      * Core Attributes (start at 100):

         * Health: Physical well-being. Low Health penalizes Combat and Stealth.

            * Degradation: Combat failures (-10 Partial, -30 Total). Critical mission failure: chance of injury.
            * Recovery: +10 Health per day (rest). Medical Facility: +20 Health per day if Health < 50 (costs -20 anonymity).
            * Criticals: <10 Health = hospitalized 3 days. <30 Health = chance of permanent injury (max Health 70 post-recovery).
            * Stamina: Physical and mental endurance. Low Stamina penalizes all skills as it degrades.

               * Degradation: -10 per mission, additional -5 on mission failure.
               * Recovery: +20 Stamina per 8 hours rest. +5 Stamina per day if idle.
               * Health-Dependent Regeneration: Stamina recovery rate modified by current Health:

                  * 75-100 Health: +0% modifier (full rate).
                  * 50-74 Health: -25% recovery.
                  * 25-49 Health: -50% recovery.
                  * <25 Health: -75% recovery.
                  * Criticals: <20 Stamina = collapse, automatic mission failure.
                  * Risks at low Stamina:
                  * ≤75: Minor Injury Risk = ((75−Stamina)×1.5%), -10 Health.
                  * ≤50: Composure Damage Risk = ((50−Stamina)×1%), -5 to -15 Composure.
                  * ≤20: Collapse Risk = ((20−Stamina)×5%), incapacitated 1 mission day.
                  * Stimulants: One-time use per agent (lifetime). +25 Stamina, -10 Composure.
                  * Composure: Psychological stability. Low Composure penalizes Deception, Intel Gathering, Interrogation.

                     * Degradation: Mission failures (-5 Bare, -20 Total).
                     * Recovery: Successful missions (+5 Solid, +10 Exceptional). +5 Composure per 8 hours rest/day. Therapy: +20 Composure (24h unavailable, one agent at a time, costs Resources).
                     * Criticals: <30 Composure = panic, abandons mission.
                     * Breakdown System: If Composure ≤50 during mission, ((50−Composure)×2%) chance of "Breakdown" (max 90%). Results in Critical Mission Failure, agent "Unusable" for 3 days (mandatory rest).
                     * Anonymity: How hidden an agent's identity/cover is. Higher Anonymity reduces overall operation exposure risk.

                        * Degradation: Mission success (-5 Solid or -10 Minimal, randomized). Failures (-15 to -25 for Total Failure). Exceptional Successes: no Anonymity loss.
                        * Recovery: +10 Anonymity per day when idle. "Burn Cover Identity": one-time +20 Anonymity boost (permanent retirement of that cover).
                        * Criticals: <40 Anonymity = +30% detection chance.
                        * Risks at low Anonymity:
                        * ≤50: Mission Penalty Risk = ((50−Anonymity)×2%), -25% penalty to mission success chance.
                        * ≤25: Stasi Attack Risk (10% chance per time block, 4 checks/day). If attacked: 50% chance of injury. Agent hides in safehouse until Anonymity > 25 (recovers +5/day idle until ≥30).
                        * Skill-Attribute Penalty Matrix:

                           * Stealth: Strong: Anonymity, Moderate: Stamina, Weak: Health.
                           * Combat: Strong: Health, Moderate: Stamina, Weak: Composure.
                           * Deception: Strong: Composure, Moderate: Anonymity, Weak: Stamina.
                           * Interrogation: Strong: Composure, Moderate: Anonymity, Weak: Stamina.
                           * Infiltration: Strong: Anonymity, Moderate: Stamina, Weak: Composure.
                           * Technical Ops: Strong: Composure, Moderate: Stamina, Weak: Anonymity.
                           * Information Ops: Strong: Anonymity, Moderate: Composure, Weak: Stamina.
                           * Intel Gathering: No attribute penalties.
                           * Adjusted Skill Formula Example (Stealth): Adjusted Stealth = Base Stealth − [((100 − Anonymity) × 0.0025) + ((100 − Stamina) × 0.0015) + ((100 − Health) × 0.0010)] (Ensure result is between 5% and 100% after final cap of 95%).
5. MISSION ACTION FORMULA
                           * Determines success/failure probability for mission actions.
                           * Base Success Chance: Agent's "Base Skill" for the primary skill (1-100%).
                           * Combine Bonuses (Multiplicative): Bonuses stack with diminishing returns. Each bonus applies to the remaining gap to 100%. Formula: Total Bonus = 1 - ((1 - Bonus1) * (1 - Bonus2) * ...)
                           * Combine Penalties (Multiplicative): Penalties stack, reducing the current success chance. Formula: Success Chance After Penalties = Current Success Chance * (1 - Penalty1) * (1 - Penalty2) * ... or effectively Total Penalty Multiplier = (1 - Penalty1) * (1 - Penalty2) * ..., so Final Chance = Base * Bonus_Effect * Penalty_Effect. The GDD states 1 - ((1 - 0.25) × (1 - 0.25)) = 0.4375 as a penalty amount, implying Effective Success Multiplier = (1-Penalty1)*(1-Penalty2).
6. INJURY MECHANICS
                           * Triggered by: Mission failures (especially Total Failure), Stamina collapse, Stasi attacks.
                           * Healing:
                           * Natural Recovery (Resting): +10 Health per day. (Note: Chosen over source 158's +5 Health/day for consistency with Health attribute section).
                           * Medical Treatment: +15 Health per day. Requires "Medical Supplies."
                           * Permanent Injuries: Require specialized intervention (prosthetics, surgery) for mitigation. Requires "Advanced Medical Supplies" and a "Medical Facility."
                           * Injury Table: See Appendix A.
7. WEATHER TYPES & EFFECTS
                           * Dynamic environmental modifiers affecting missions.
                           * Forecast provided in Daily Intel Report.
                           * Weather Effects Table: See Appendix E (Weather Conditions) and Appendix I (Daily Weather Reports for Oct 1985).
8. SKILL PROGRESSION SCALING (CRITICAL SUCCESS BONUSES)
                           * Agents improve skills on critical mission success. Applies to primary skill and actively contributing secondary skill.
                           * Primary Skill Increase: max(1, floor((100 − Current Skill) × 0.05))
                           * Secondary Skill Increase: max(1, floor((100 − Current Skill) × 0.02))
9. COMPREHENSIVE ACTION DURATION ESTIMATION SYSTEM
                           * Provides estimated time ranges for Mission Actions and Intel Gathering.
                           * Special Orders (Rest, Therapy, etc.): Fixed, short durations (e.g., 1 hour).
                           * A. Base Action Durations:

                              * Mission Actions: 16 - 24 hours.
                              * Intel Gathering: 12 - 20 hours.
                              * B. Dynamic Modifiers: Applied sequentially. Percentage adjustments use original Base Duration.

                                 * Initial Range: Current_Min_Hours = Base_Min_Duration, Current_Max_Hours = Base_Max_Duration.
                                 * Mission Primary Skill Type Base Adjustments (flat hours, not for Intel Gathering):

                                    * Combat: Min +2h, Max +2h.
                                    * Stealth: Min -2h, Max -2h.
                                    * Information Ops: Max +2h.
                                    * Deception: Min -2h.
                                    * Interrogation: Max -2h.
                                    * Infiltration: Min +2h.
                                    * Technical Ops: Min -1h, Max +1h.
                                    * Agent Primary Skill Multiplicative Adjustment:

                                       * Skill_Percentage_Adjustment = ((Agent's Relevant Primary Skill - 50.5) / 49.5) * 0.15
                                       * Duration_Multiplier_Skill = 1 - Skill_Percentage_Adjustment
                                       * Current_Min_Hours *= Duration_Multiplier_Skill
                                       * Current_Max_Hours *= Duration_Multiplier_Skill
                                       * Agent Attribute Impact (penalty to max duration):

                                          * Attribute_Penalty_Percentage = ((100 - Agent's Relevant Attribute Score) / 99) * 0.15
                                          * Stamina Impact (Combat, Infiltration, Stealth, Tech Ops): Add (original Base Max Duration * Attribute_Penalty_Percentage) to Current_Max_Hours.
                                          * Composure Impact (Deception, Interrogation, Info Ops, Intel Gathering): Add (original Base Max Duration * Attribute_Penalty_Percentage) to Current_Max_Hours.
                                          * External Factors (Weather - from Daily Intel):

                                             * Heavy Snow/Rain: Current_Max_Hours += 0.10 * original Base Max Duration.
                                             * Blizzard/Extreme Fog (<0.5km): Current_Max_Hours += 0.25 * original Base Max Duration.
                                             * Clear/Optimal: Current_Min_Hours -= 0.05 * original Base Min Duration.
                                             * Time of Day:

                                                * Night Bonus (Stealth, Deception, Infiltration, Info Ops, Intel Gathering AT Night): Current_Min_Hours -= 0.05 * original Base Min Duration.
                                                * Daytime Penalty (Stealth, Deception, Infiltration, Info Ops IN Day/Unfavorable Time): Current_Max_Hours += 0.05 * original Base Max Duration.
                                                * C. Final Range & Actual Duration:
                                                * Round Current_Min/Max_Hours to nearest whole hour.
                                                * Min displayed duration ≥ 1 hour; range width ≥ 1 hour.
                                                * Actual time taken: Randomly determined within [Final Min Hours - Final Max Hours].
11. TIME ADVANCEMENT SYSTEM
                                                * Time measured in hours and days. Day: morning, day, evening, night.
                                                * Advances via player actions (consuming time) and manual "Advance Time" option. Agent actions consume 6-24 hours; issuing an action generally consumes 1 hour.
                                                * Consequences of Time Passage: New intel (daily reports), mission modifiers from daily intel, agent attribute adjustments, exposure consequences (Stasi attacks if low anonymity).
                                                * Time Limit: 30 days for MAIN mission.
                                                * UI: Constantly visible clock (time, date, weather).
12. MISSION SYSTEM & CONTENT
                                                * Missions start as "leads," investigated to reveal actionable options.
                                                * Mission chains viewable on "corkboard."
                                                * Mission Type Obfuscation: Player doesn't know if a lead is core, alternative, or side until completion. Core mission completion is signaled by uncovering WHO, WHERE, or WHEN intel.
                                                * Action Selection Information: Objective, required skills, bonuses/penalties, estimated time.
                                                * Agent Selection Information: List of agents with skills, attributes, current bonuses/penalties.
                                                * Mission Success/Failure: Roll check against agent's adjusted skill with modifiers. Outcomes based on "Mission Action Success Levels." Consequences: injury, compromised intel, bonus resources, penalty to next action, new lead. Final mission is binary win/lose.
                                                * Alternative Missions: Grant bonuses to final mission (e.g., +10% Stealth).
                                                * Main Mission Completion: Requires WHO, WHERE, and WHEN from CORE missions. Player then plans final mission, can await specific time. Final mission: "execute operation Thunderbolt."
                                                * Mission Types List: See Appendix F.
13. AGENT MANAGEMENT & PROGRESSION
                                                * Player starts with a pre-set agent roster.
                                                * Special Agent Actions (via roster profile): Rest, stimulants, therapy, safehouse.
                                                * Progression: Small XP and skill gain (5% skill bonus subject to diminishing returns on primary skill) on critical successes. No dedicated training system.
                                                * Critical Mission Failure Consequences: Penalty to agent's next mission, chance of injury (random from injury table, severity influenced by existing injuries), greater attribute degradation.
14. EXTERNAL FACTORS & DYNAMIC EVENTS
                                                * Weather and time of day (based on historical Oct 1985 West Berlin data) apply bonuses/penalties.
                                                * Daily intel reports provide weather forecasts and list local events/enemy activity that may modify missions (can be narrative).
                                                * Future: Random event system, dynamic political climate (not in initial version).
15. USER INTERFACE (UI) & PRESENTATION
                                                * Theme: "Behind the desk POV," Cold War espionage. Teletype is central for information.
                                                * Desk UI Elements & Functions:

                                                   * Teletype Machine: Primary information display, mission results, intel delivery. (Python: 80s terminal style).
                                                   * Mission Logs Folder: Access to historical mission reports.
